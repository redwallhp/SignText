SignText
========

This Bukkit plugin makes it easier to edit signs in Minecraft. Just select a sign by pointing the reticle over it (so the outline appears around the block) and running the /signtext command. Supports [colors](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes) with the & character.

    /signtext <line> <text>
    /signtext 1 This word is &4RED
